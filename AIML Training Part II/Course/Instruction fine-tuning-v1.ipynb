Also, the responses have the tendency to extend and repeat the answers until they generate the maximum number of tokens. Later on, you can see that the instruction-tuning can fix both of these issues. First, the instruction fine-tuned model will be able to provide more meaningful responses. Second, because, you appended the `eos` token `<\\s>` to the output, you will teach the model via instruction fine-tuning to not generate responses without bound.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"093c2323-7db6-4aac-ab26-d95510535d31","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## BLEU score\n","\n","Let's set up a metric that compares the generated responses and the expected responses in the test environment. In this lab, let's use the [BLEU score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLEU), a metric originally intended to check the quality of translations made by translation models. You can calculate the BLEU scores for individual generated segments by comparing them with a set of expected outputs and average the scores for the individual segments. Depending on the implementation, BLEU scores range from 0 to 1 or from 0 to 100 (as in the implementation used herein), with higher scores indicating a better match between the model generated output and the expected output.\n","\n","_**Note:**_ \n","1. The BLEU score was originally implemented for assessing the quality of translations. However, it may not necessarily be the best metric for instruction fine-tuning in general, but it is nonetheless a useful metric that gives a sense of the alignment between the model generated output and the expected output.\n","2. BLEU scores are very challenging to compare from one study to the next because it is a parametrized metric.
